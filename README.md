# Malicious Python
python code but Painful




**how to run: **

all of my code within this repository is in **Python ** 
so in order to run it you will need:
- Python 3 installed
- pip (to install the modules(most of them auto install the modules))
- to make a new file called [whatever you want].py
- then just paste the code into the file and save it



if you run it YOU can find the password for any of them in the code. 


also just wanna say if any of this code somehow hurts your computer, im not liable for any of that stuffs.
